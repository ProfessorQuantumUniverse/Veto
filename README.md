## What is Veto?

Veto is an Android client for VirusTotal. Submit a file, a link, or an installed application to view real-time analysis results. The application displays a clear report ranging from a single unified verdict to the complete set of fields returned by the service.

The project is free and open source, containing no user accounts, tracking systems, or advertising. Because users supply their own VirusTotal API key, all scans run directly under their personal account without being routed through intermediate third-party servers.

## Feature Set

* **Scan Capability:** Scan installed apps, local files, or target URLs.
* **Multi-Engine Aggregation:** Combines diagnostics from over 70 antivirus engines.
* **Dual Reporting Modes:** Quick mode for rapid verification summaries, and Detailed mode for deep inspection.
* **Contextual Explanations:** Explanatory text is available for every section, with a setting to hide explanations if desired.
* **High-Fidelity Reports:** Displays file hashes, threat classifications, history, community votes, sandbox behaviors, YARA matches, Android application internals, and all additional API payload fields.
* **Background Execution:** Real-time upload and analysis progress tracking that persists inside a background service.
* **Offline Access:** Saves reports locally to allow review at a later time, even without an internet connection.
* **Rate Limit Warnings:** Displays clear notifications when the local API key reaches its rate limit.
* **Theming:** Full Material 3 support with dynamic system colors, supporting both light and dark themes.

### Core Architecture Implementation Details

* **State Synchronization:** The application scoped `ScanManager` serves as the centralized source of truth for all scanning states. This ensures that the user interface remains synchronized whether the app is active in the foreground, suspended in the background, or destroyed by the operating system.
* **Resilient Polling:** The app polls the `/analyses/{id}` endpoint using a six-minute wall clock cap. If a rate limit response is encountered, the process waits rather than failing. The report is re-fetched until the results are populated, returning a structured failure state if the timeout limit is reached.
* **Process Lifecycle:** While the `ScanState` resides within the `ScanManager` to survive Activity destruction, `ScanService` maintains the process lifecycle during active operations and manages ongoing and completion notifications.
* **Full Fidelity Parsing:** Common fields are captured using typed models, while the complete raw `attributes` JSON is retained via a custom serializer. This allows the Detailed report view to render all returned fields, including any new fields added to the API payload over time.
